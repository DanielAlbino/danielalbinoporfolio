                            Hi! I'm Daniel, nice to meet you.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I became a developer, because I like to create things, develop things that could help people in their day-to-day life.
                            So in 2007 I decided to study Computer Science in High School. There I learned about many tools to create things like programming languages, image editors, etc.
                            At the end or 3 years I had aa 3 months internship where I developed a small webpage using the tools I learned in school.
                            <br>
                            After some years in 2013 I decided to go to the next level, so I did another course, but this time in Network and Software management. 
                            In this course I've learned how a network works and learned a few new porgramming languages.
                            Since 2014 until 2018 I've worked in networking, but my passion is developement so in October 2018 I decided to change my career and I get an opportunity to work as a developer.
                            Always learning new skills and get better at the previous ones.
                            <br>
                            Besides my professional path, In my free time, I've been developing multiple things. I've developed tools for the financial market, for web, designed logos, mockups, learn about pixelart, and developed some simple games.
                            <br><br>
                            I learn that we must never give up our dreams and fight for to achieve them.

                                    Since 2017 I've been developing some tools for the forex market. Those tools, developed in C, can help the trader to make decisions.
                                    <br>
                                    I've developed indicators based on traders feedback, like what kind of commun indicators they work with, and with that creating my own indicators.
                                    Those indicators helped the traders to have more than 70% of winning trades.

                                    My path as a web developer started in 2010 in my curricular intership, where I've developed a small webpage using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Joomla.
                                    This small webpage was the final project for the course. However in 2018 I've get an opportunity to work as Full Stack Developer where I take my skills to another level.
                                    In the Company I've worked with I had the opportunity to learn Javascript frameworks such as Vue.js and Node.js and some NoSql Databases like MongoDB.
                                    There I've developed the Company's website, primarely using HTML, CSS and Javascript, but after a while I implemented Strapi, a CMS, in the backend, in that way any person had the capabilaty to add information to the webpage.
                                    Besides of that project, I've developed a small webscrapper, that gathers a specific information from another place, with node.js calls, using axios module and than with Express I developed the paths to make calls from the frontend.
                                    The front end was developed in Vue.js.
        
                                    In my personal time, I've been learning about other things, like React.js, Python and others.

                                In 2020, I have the idea to create some game to play, something that I would like to play for myself, but I didn't know how to play, so I started to learn about game developement.
                                I started to search on the internet about what tools I must use and I found Unity and C#, using those tools I've been able to develop some Games. 
                                Besides using Unity and C# I've started using Phaser.js for HTML game development. I've already developed some small games like angry birds alike game, Mr Pudding - Survival Mode, 4096 game, and others.
